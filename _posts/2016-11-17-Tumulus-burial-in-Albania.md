title: Tumulus-burial in Albania

Tumulus-burial was characteristic of Illyrian tribes both to the north of Albanian and in Albania, but was customary also among other pastoral groups which were Greek-speaking, e.g. in central Epirus and in western Macedonia (in Pelagonia and Eordaea) or Phrygian-speaking (e.g. below Vergina). A great expansion of Illyria tribes occurred from c 900 BC onwards, the center from which they they came being Glasinac in Central Yugoslavia… The leading warriors buried in some of these tumuli had as many as ten spears each in heir graves. Tribes from the Glasinac area entered North and Centarl Albania in large numbers and overran the existing Illyrian tribes. The names of the leading tribes are preserved in a genealogical form, which came from a Greek source.7 Illyrius, son of the Cyclops Polyphemus and his lady Galatea, had various sons and daughters, of whom some were eponyms of the Darwinians (in Metohija and Kosovo), the Taulantii (from Tirana southwards), Encheleae (by Lake Ohrid), and Parthini (middle and upper Shkumbi valley). Illyrius himself wa the eponym of the Illyria, a tribe inland of Lethe, from which the Greeks extended the name to all peoples of similar speech. The expansion carried some groups of warriors into central Epirus, others into Central Macedonia, and one group to Halus on South Thessaly, where a tumuli contained remains of men and woman with words, knives and spears of the eight century BC…(N.G.L. Hammond in Winnifrith,Tom, Perspective on Albania, 1992, p.34)

It was in 1963 that I first heard of this journal and late in 1964 that I obtained an offprint of the Vajzë report through the kindness of the excavator, Professor Frano Prendi. He dated the tumuli and their contents to the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age and to the early centuries of the Iron Age, but I have advanced the view in my book that the earliest of these tumuli and the earliest burials in such tumuli date to the Middle Helladic period. When this went to press in December 1964, I was able to publish also a few objects from the tumuli of the Mati valley which were illustrated in the same journal for 1955, and appeared to be of Middle Helladic date but had been dated by the excavator to the end of the Bronze Age at the earliest. Late in 1965 I was sent by Professor Frano Prendi a copy of a new Albanian periodical Studia Albanica, no. i of 1964. Here the same dates were given for the tumuli of North Epirus and of the Mati valley but reference was made for the first time in my experience to a Middle Helladic dating of tumuli and of objects which had been found at Pazhok. This material was too late to be included in my book. As the evidence at Pazhok is conclusive for the Middle Helladic dating, I give a summary of the brief report, which this time was in French, and I reproduce the illustrations which were not of a high standard. The reports of all these excavations have escaped the notice of scholars in the western countries, so far as I am aware…
<p>The period of Illyrian control in the plain of Macedonia lasted from c. 800 to c. 650 B.C. The evidence has survived almost entirely in warrior-graves and women’s graves which were much less numerous. There were cremations sometimes in urns, as well as inhumations, large pithoi were used as coffins, e.g. at Vergina; and burials were grouped together, sometimes under a tumulus and sometimes not. New articles were bronze pendants of various kinds, bronze belt-plates, large bronze spectacle-fibulae, armlets of thin bronze wire and armlets of heavy bronze metal with incised decoration, and many bronze beads of various shapes. At Vergina, where the same cemetery was used for Illyrian chieftains, two new forms of bowl were evidently copied from wooden prototypes, such as are made by the Vlachs in modern times. New tumuli constructed for Illyrian chieftains contained many spearheads and spear-butts, sickle-shaped knives and heavy bracelets. The homeland of these new elements was in central Yugoslavia, and the typical site there was Glasinac, where the tumuli were numbered in thousands.<p>In the cemetery at Vergina the period of greatest prosperity, c. 900-800 B.C., was followed by radical changes and a growing impoverishment. In some tumuli the partly cremated remains were placed in urns, and sickle shaped knives with whetstones and spears over two metres in length with iron head and iron butt accompanied some of the warriors. In Upper Macedonia the presence of lllyrian rulers was shown by burials with similar weapons and ornaments at Visoi and Petilep in Pelagoma; at Pateli in Eordaea, and at Vucedol near Skopje and by Titov Veles. Objects typical of them have been found in small numbers at Kozani and at sites in the middle Haliacmon valley. To the east of the Vardar they seem to have driven the Paeonians back towards the Strymon valley, and there are concentrations of Illyrian objects at Kumanovo and at Radanja near Stip. Large numbers of tumuli are reported in this area; some at least were made probably for Illyrian warriors. Other groups of Illyrians established themselves in the middle Strymon valley, where their name in Classical times was the Maedi; in the Kumli valley between Doiran and Serres; and in the vicinity of Amphipolis. There were penetrations also into northwest Bulgaria and even beyond the Danube in Rumania.
 
Testing! The expansion of the Illyrian tribes had some effects also on northern and central Greece. At Vitsa in Zagori burials were made in shallow trenches, or in cist-graves roofed with branches on which stones were placed, or under a cairn of stones. The burials were close-packed; set in three layers, and very close to the settlement, and the cemetery was in use from just before 900 B.C. into the fifth century B.C. To judge from the objects buried with the dead this community had contacts with Barc, vergina, Vodhine, the Illyrians, and also southern Greece.(Hammond 1976: 154/155)

According to this view the impact of this Immigration was limited, and, if it had caused population movements  in Epirus, it was the Illyrian tribes that were affected. The inference that the language of the area was North-west Greek is pervious and has no historic support. R. A. Crossaland elaborated about the language of this area prior to the onset of Iron Age and concluded that The phonetic characteristics of some place-names in central and northern Greece have been thought to prove that Illyrians or closely related peoples were settled there before the Greek language was introduced . <img src="http://albter.eu5.org/images/AncientGreece.jpg" width="220" height="144" align="right" />If they were, Greeks must have migrated into southern Epirus early in the first millennium at the latest.

Although archeological Bronze Age data for south Epirus area…is limited, evidence that is available is similar to that found north of this area. One thing that has been pointed out is the find of potsherds at Dodona, which probably represent a settlement of M. H. time and shows distant connection with Macedonia. (p. 127, The Cambridge Ancient History, II, part 1, 2000). N. G. L. Hammond himself indicated that “The archeological evidence shows that Greek culture, as revealed in pottery and other objects, did not penetrate into inland Epirus, except at Dodona and there only to a very limited extent, until the fourth century”.
