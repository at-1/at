Modem historiography and archaeology received their strongest initial impetus from the works of Germanophone scholarship in the 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the German and Habsburg political and colonial interests in southeastern Europe. Zippel wrote a monograph on the Roman conquests in Illyricum, relying mostly on the interpretation of literary sources.

This book was of very high standards for the period, and frequent referencing in later works shows that it established foundations for the contemporary historical narrative of the Roman conquest of the region's indigenous communities, but also research of political institutions among these communities just before the Roman conquest.35 Equally important and influential on scholarly thought was the so-called "Panillyrian" discourse. The German archaeologist Gustaf Kossinna postulated massive migrations of the late Bronze Age Umfielders toward southeastern Europe and the Aegean Sea. He ascribed the origins of these Umfielders to the Lusatian and South-German Urnfielder cultures, who were in his opinion pushed from there by victorious Germans moving from Jutland in 1800-1700 B.C. Kossinna's interpretation of the ethnicity of these cultures varied over time, but in one instance he ascribed the Lusatian culture to the Illyrians. This "solved" two issues at the same time. First, it defined when and from where the ancestors of the Germans settled in Germany. Second, it made the descendants of pre-Gennan inhabitants of Germany the indirect founders of classical Greek civilization, which is in full compliance with his opinion that Central European prehistory was not inferior to the Mediterranean cultures. Kossinna drew his views from contemporary German and other western European research, which saw the Illyrians as a distinct IndoEuropean linguistic group and, in accordance with 19th-century views, as a distinct "racial" category. 36 </br> Balkanistica 27 (2014) 14 DANIJEL DZINO <p>German paleo-linguists such as Krahe and Pokomy enthusiastically accepted the ideas of Kossinna, trying to justify and strengthen these views by providing paleo-linguistic evidence of massive prehistoric migrations. Krahe revised his opinions only in the second volume of his study of the Illyrian language, published in 1964, when it became obvious that Panillyrian positions were untenable. Carl Schuchhardt took a slightly different interpretation than Kossinna. He believed Germans from the Lausitz culture migrated south and fused with the Neolithic Danubian population (proto-Illyrians), creating Illyrians.37 The basic idea of Illyrians as the Umfielders and one of the main participants in the Aegean migrations influenced scholarship for decades, even after 1945, when Kossinna was largely abandoned in scholarly literature, since his views were embraced by the Nazi regime (although he himself died in 1931 ). 38

At this time, a significant corpus of German scholarly works developed on the ancient history and prehistory of Croatia and especially Bosnia and Herzegovina, a virgin area for archaeologists prior to the Austro-Hungarian takeover by the Ottomans in 1878.39 While interest in Slovenia and Croatia in prehistory and ancient history reveals political interests, as they were part of Austria-Hungary, the archaeology was carried out primarily by local archaeologists. However, the situation was significantly different in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where archaeology developed as a colonial discipline after 1878. In the course of a few decades of focused and well-funded archaeological, anthropological and ethnographic work, there resulted a significant corpus of finds from Roman and medieval times, but in particular from prehistory.40 Antiquarians and early archaeologists in the western parts of Illyrian lands focused on the more visible and more abundant Roman provincial finds. Pre-Roman communities were overall insufficiently known, so these discoveries in Austro-Hungarian Bosnia and Herzegovina were crucial for developing an early archaeological picture of preRoman Illyrians.

Although never as influential as German historiography, older Italian scholarship was also interested in developing a particular narrative of Illyrian prehistory. Research was focused on establishing linlcs between the prehistoric Veneti and Illyrians -projecting Italian political interests in the Dalmatian coast through the developing common prehistory of North Italy and trans-Adriatic regions. The culmination probably came with Italian archaeological interests in Albania in the 1920s and 1930s. Research was focused in particular on finding evidence of Aeneas travelling to Italy via Albania, providing an interesting Balkanistica 27 (2014).




<p><strong><h2 style="color:blue">Ethnicity and religion in Ottoman Empire</h2>
<p>Because of their historical connection with the Patriarchate, the Greeks came to represent, and speak on the behalf, of the entire Christendom in Europe and Asia. The Orthodox Patriarchate, shielded by Ottoman might, enjoyed power and prestige to a degree unknown even during the heyday of Byzantium…As an ethnic group, the Greeks were the first to be given positions within the high Ottoman bureaucracy without having to convert to Islam… p. 46

<p>Aided by this privileged position and strong european economic considerations as a trading distribution center, as well as western infatuation with ancient Greece,  Greeks were able to create a fast expanding middle class which, in turn, caused an increase in the size of the Greek-speaking population and of groups that identified with the Greek Patriarchate, regardless of their ethnic origins. 47 <img src="http://albter.eu5.org/images/7-page-0011.jpg" width="247" height="162" align="right" />
<p>It was a reality where people were identified on the bases of religion and not ethnicity. All Moslems were classified as Turks, while the privileged Greek position in the Ottoman Empire distorted the identification of people in favor of “Greeks”.  The term “Greeks” (Rum) originally encompassed all Orthodox Christians; however, during the the nineteenth century it acquired a narrower meaning, and those who who retains their allegations to the Istanbul patriarchate and to to the other Greek national churches… came to be termed “Orthodox Greeks.” p. 108 The primary victim of this policy were the Albanians, majority of Albanians were identified as Muslim, and the Orthodox Christians, could not have their own national church and were classified as Greeks.

<p>Thus when it comes to determining the size of the Albanian population, the known numbers are only a guesstimate. But even these estimates, prove that a drastic reduction of Albanian population occurred during the eighteenth century, more specifically after the Greek independence. In 1840 a population 1,500,000 Albanians was estimated. By 1876-78 the estimate had been reduced to 1,031,000, but evidently many of Albanians were put under the classification “Greek Albanians” (in addition to the classification “Orthodox Albanians”; this figure also excluded Albanians within the state of independent Greece). By 1890’s the Albanian population is estimated at 1,217,000, indicating that substantial number of Albanians ceased to be counted as Albanian.

<p>The the well known practice of misidentifying populations by Balkan governments and nationalist associations was common. All tried to enlarge their respective nationalities and accordingly reduce other groups. The claimed numbers were so unreliable, so that  H. Synge, a military officer sent especially by the British embassy in Istanbul to find out exact number of the Macedonian population, stated in a preliminary report that the total Greek male population of Selanik, Manastir, Serez. and Drama amounted in 1878 to only 166,064, as against 116,024 Bulgarians, 50,152 Vlahs (Romanians, and 25,043 Albanians (who also recognized the Greek Patriarchate in Istanbul)…p.48

<p>The unfortunate truth is that these false claims effective in convincing European powers to decide to the determent of  the Albanians when it came to determining borders of Albania, and in the process designating large Albanian populations as non-entities. But the reality is that this is symptomatic of how Balkan nations have evolved, on false claims and at the expense of the Albanians.
