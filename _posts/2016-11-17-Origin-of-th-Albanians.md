The origination of human communities with common characteristics is a long and complex evolutionary process. In Albania, according to archaeologists, this process has its beginning in the Neolithic and Eneolithic periods (that is between the seventh and fourth millennium B. C.). The changes that took place during this time are fundamental to understanding the beginnings of eventual creation of ethnicities and languages in the Balkan Peninsula. 

<p>In Albania, neolithic centers have been found in the plain of Korca, followed by those on the banks of rivers Dri, Mat, Shkumbin and Vijose. The lowlands adjoining the sea and isolated areas remained sparsely populated, indicating that the population favored continental roads that lead to more important centers of civilization in Macedonia, Thessaly or Danube. 
The beginning of the Neolithic period is attested by the discovery of fragments of primitive pottery and flinstone work tools in the settlement of Vlushe in Skrapar highlands; the appearance of a multitude of microliths would indicate that the settlement had evolved directly from the Mesolithic period. Clay pottery with high relieves, or impressions of Starchevo I, discovered at a settlement in Burim (Peshkopia region) would point to connection of the area with that of central Balkans. (Ceka, N., Iliret, 2001, p. 29) This would be an indication that this wide area was evolving with a common culture, with similar physical, psychological, and linguistic characteristics. <p><img src="http://albter.eu5.org/images/EpirusMycynaen.jpg" width="220" height="144" align="right" />Testing! </div>

<p>Millenniums V-IV provided marked progress in the life of settlements; this is evidenced by the capability to construct platforms over the river Dunavec, over which huts were put. Advances are also indicated in pottery as many styles and decorations were put to use, in styles similar to that of Pelagonia (Terna, Velushka Tumba III-IV) and Thessali (Tsangli I). A more advanced level of this cultural is observed in Cekran, in the lower valley of Vjosa River, represented by a settlement of partially submerged huts. In addition to the local pottery, fragments of wares of type Thessaly (Tsangly and Dimini phase) design have appeared. (Ceka, N., Iliret, 2001, p. 30 ) 

<p>At around 2600 B.C. important changes are indicated to have taken place in the life of Maliq/Korce settlement. Copper work tools are seen to be in use, such as hatchets, needles and fishing hooks. This evident economic advance is manifested in indications of inter-regional trade, as indicated by the southward spread of Albano-Dalmation axe. Finds of many Myceanian objects indicates that trade with Hellas and the Aegean area had also increased. (Korkuti, M., Parailiret, Iliret, Arberit, 2003, p. 49) 
<p>The effect of Maliq culture could be observed in settlements at Drin and Mat River valleys.Â Similarities in decoration and cult objects are also noted with settlements in Dardania (Hisar I, Glladnice Bubanj Hun Ia),Pelagonia (Servia, Armenohori). More general affinities are observed Dikili-Tash (Thessaly), Sulkuca (Rumania), Krividol (Bulgaria) and as far as Troy. (Ceka, p. 32) Examination of ground layers in Dersniku and Barci (in Korce area) indicates elements of locally developed Neolithic culture. (Ceka, p. 32) 
<p><img src="http://albter.eu5.org/images/Archaeological-centers.png" align="right" />At the same time, Archeologist Frano Prendi discerned elements of regional differences during the Neolithic period. He concluded that it appears that culturally these settlements related to three distinct centers. The settlements of Podgorie and VeshtemiÂ with shinny monochrome pottery or with white over a red background relate with Thessalo-Macedonian Neolithic period. Kukes area settlement with its clay pottery and use of brown color over a red base relates to eastern Dardania and beyond (Starcevo IIb). Mat area is characterized with ' impresso-cardium' decoration and a variety of motives, and a monochrome pottery usually grey to black in color decorated with cardium impressions relates to eastern Adriatic cultures (Smilcic I). (Prendi, F., The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, pp. 192-93)
<p>The discovered settlements, extending from Podgorie and Vashtem in plain of Korca, in Kolsh of Kukes, or use of caves in Blaz in Mati and Katundas of Berat, the multiple cultural layers, and specifically the increasing number of tools made from flintstone, sharpened stone or bone, points to an increased population with an active economic role. As a reflection of this economic reality there are indications of an active ritual and spiritual activity also. Finds of anthropomorphic idols, made of baked clay of Magna Mater type, point to a spiritual life based on concepts relating to origin and community. These cult-rhytones are found in a area from Split (Danilo) in the north to Korith in the south (Elateia), from central Bosnia (Kakanji), in Kosova (Reshtan), in Korce basin (Dunavec), and as far as Thessaly (Drahmani). The improved economic productivity, as well as the active cultural/religious life must have contributed to the integration of the population of this wide area. (Ceka, N./Korkuti, M., Arkeologjia, 1998, p. 41) 
<p>Dunavec and Cekran have a similar pottery, as well as objects of cult such as sat terracotta woman and four-legged zoomphoric shoots. The latter are an essential element also in the culture of Kolsh II, which together with Blazi II, Katundas II and Kosovar settlement at Rudnik IV relates fully to the Adriatic cultural area. To this tradition of pottery as well as cult impressions should also be mentioned the cult of burial under the dwelling floors in sleeping positions (Dunavec, Cakran, Rudnik and that of Bosnia). Thus, in a reality of divergences started to develop convergences, in a space that was later to be identified as Illyrian inhabited. (Ceka, N., Iliret, pp. 30-31) 
<p>On the basis of the data that these settlements have given, Albanian archeologists are of the opinion that the present state of our knowledge, we cannot define with certainty the physical type of the peoples who lived in Albania in the Neo-Eneolithic period. Neither can we make any firm judgments as to the ethnic associations of the cultural groups which we have been describing, in spite of the divergent opinions of linguists and archaeologists on the Indo-European or non-Indo-European character of the Neolithic populations of the Balkans. (p. 224) 
<p>It appears that this cultural reality was shaken at about 2100 BC, as new cultural effects have impacted the existing Neolithic culture.  At Maliq entirely new elements appear, especially in pottery, which is distinguished from that of the Eneolithic period by its generally more primitive character. Frano Prendi summarizes the evidence relating to this period as follows: 
<p>The most common shapes include vases with two handles above the rim, of Armenokhori type; cups with handles level with or rising above the rim; vases of various shapes with two small handles below the mouthpiece, jugs with tall cylindrical necks, bowls with four small handles below the rim, little cups shaped like a truncated cone with a lip on the rim, and bowls with inverted rims (fig. 38). Other new elements in the pottery of this phase are tongue-shaped handles with decoration, finger-impressions, lug handles, etc. Conspicuous in the decorative styles of this phase are decorations in relief: impressed cords, simple circular bands with V or U shapes, buttons, nipples, and clusters of parallel ribs. Common too is the decoration made by the impression of the finger or nail, or spattered 'pseudo-Barbotine'â€¦ Of particular chronological and cultural interest are some fragments of vessels decorated with stippled triangles, whose decoration recalls the most typical pottery of the Kostolac group (above, p. 155). 
<p>All this pottery, hitherto unknown in Albania, was found in the Maliq Ilia layer, together with other objects peculiar to the Eneolithic period at Maliq. Of the latter, one may mention vases with an S-shaped profile, often decorated with shallow grooves on the shoulders and dishes with rolled rims, designs in black paint or incised, a number of anchor-shaped amulets, which had appeared for the first time at Maliq in the Eneolithic layer as indications of the Aegean Early Bronze Age, terracotta spoons with short handles, numerous weights for fishing-nets, and some cruciform figurines of terracotta in the Maliq II style, and many stone, bone and horn implements in the Eneolithic tradition. 
<p>The fact that we find in the Maliq Ilia level the material peculiar to the previous autochthonous foundation mixed in an unexpected and abrupt way with large quantities of the new ceramic material which we have described above, indicates that we have here the appearance of a new ethnic element which penetrated this area of south-east Albania towards the end of the Eneolithic period and the beginning of the Bronze Age, and did not destroy the local Eneolithic population but intermingled with them or lived amongst them, creating certain changes in their economic and ethno-cultural structureby an internal development which was able to assimilate or reject particular features, the Early Bronze Age civilization of Maliq took a developed shape and close-knit form. It can be said that some pottery shapes and styles of this period at Maliq, including the corded ware, is most closely associated with the Armenokhori group in Pelagonia, which in terms of Aegean chronology is dated towards the end of the Early Bronze Age. Some particular features of Maliq Ilia and Illb pottery are seen too in other Early Bronze Age sites in Macedonia such as Servia, Kritsana, Ayios Mamas and elsewhere, and similarly in Epirus.(p. 213) 
<p>According to Prendi the invasions had a limited effect on existing settlements. The same settlements from Eneolithic period continued their life. Important settlements like Maliq, Neziri, Treni, Benja show no interruption in cultural layers. Pottery, as indicated above does show an impact from the the invasions that occurred at the end of Neolithic period. But at the same time, he evidences the existence of material that was characteristic of the previous period, indicating that the autochthonous population was an important composite of the population and culture that evolved. The cultural effects of this population could also be seen in the continuation of burial ritual, in which the dead bodies were placed in sleeping positions within their dwellings, and the use of terracotta in a crosswise design. It would be reasonable to assume that the Albanian territory was not overwhelmed by the people from the steppe at the same degree as were other territories in southern Balkans. (Ceka, N.,Iliret, p.35) 
<p>A characteristic associated with the new comers has been the practice of tumulus burial, characteristic of the steppe people. This burial rite spread through Albania, as elsewhere in the north-west Balkans, towards the beginning of the Bronze Age, and not, as has been believed generally, during the Middle Bronze Age. (Prendi, F., p. 235) According to Albanian archeologists, discovered tumuli at Vajze, Vodhine, three tumuli at Pozhak, and one in Mat were built during the middle Bronze Age, while tumuli at Patos, Dukat, Prodan, Rehoves, Bardhoc, Krune, some of the Mat and Pozhak, etc., are reflective of late Bronze Age. N.G.L. Hammond indicated that the tumulus at Pazhok has dating that corresponds to Middle Helladic period. (The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, p. 229) 
<p>According to Prendi, the invasions did not interrupt cultural affinity of Albanian territories with Macedonia and the Aegean. He indicated that some pottery shapes and styles at Maliq related to the Armenokhori group in Pelagonia, and that â€œsome particular features of Maliq Ilia and Illb pottery are seen too in other Early Bronze Age sites in Macedonia such as Servia, Kritsana, Ayios Mamas and elsewhere, and similarly in Epirus.(Prendi, F., p. 213) 
<p>In reality, there in an increase in Creto-Mycenaean arms and pottery in Albanian at this time. Albanian archaeologists attribute this to the active trading relationship between the Albanian area and the Aegean. They indicate that this trade is related of the demand of area's tribal aristocracies for luxury products. (Ceka, N./Korkuti, M., Archeologjia, p. 55) Some, on the other hand, see this area as having been colonized by Creto-Mycenaeans. 
<p>No sense in repeating, but in the view of Albanian archaeologists there is no evidence of an invasion from south, and the only impact has been from the settlers of a different culture that came from the north, mentioned above, Â and that to a limited extent. Commenting on this subject, Prendi would conclude: attempts to interpret in any other way the Middle Helladic elements in Albania have, it seems, no solid foundation. Thus, for example, one cannot possibly explain the presence of these elements so typical of the Greek Middle Bronze Age by the assumption that the early Mycenaeans colonized Albania in the seventeenth and sixteenth centuries B.C. The fact that these examples of Creto-Mycenaean civilization are found not only in the border areas, but equally in the interior, in geographically isolated places such as Mati, and often too in association with locally made pottery of native tradition in the tombs, goes to show that these burial-grounds belong to a native population and not to one originating from the south. (Prendi, F., p. 219) 
<p>By the middle of the Bronze age, Maliq IIIc and Neziri cultures reveal many common elements. (Ceka, N.,Iliret, p.35) By the end of Broze Age, Maliq IIId shows wares to be decorated with geometric motives over a lustrous brown background. The motifs follow the earlier linear geometric style, naturally enriched by new motifs and more complex designs. The pottery painted before firing links Maliq IIId3 firmly with western Macedonia, represented by Boubousti, and equally with the Late Bronze Age painted pottery of central Macedonia. Frano Prendi saw a similarity in painted pottery found in Epirus with that of Maliq. N. L. G. Hammond indicated that the tumulus at Pazhok has dating that corresponds to Middle Helladic period. (The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, p. 629) Â He indicated that pottery painted after baking pertains to a period prior to the 1300 B.C. and would conclude: 
<p>Painted pottery like that of Maliq III d3 has been known in Epirus, but opinions vary as to when it first appeared in north-west Greece. We do not know of any site outside the Korce basin which has this pottery painted after firing and is of autochthonous origin, as it is at Maliq. Further, it is only at Maliq that we see the origins of this style. (N. L. G. Hammond indicated that the tumulus at Pazhok has dating that corresponds to Middle Helladic period. (The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, p. 222) 
<p>This pottery has been named devollite. It originated and flourished at the basin of River Devoll. During the Iron Age, this pottery characterized the whole of southern Illyrian areas.Â It is this pottery that is considered to provide a direct link between the Bronze Age population and the historical time population known as Illyrian. (Ceka, N., Iliret, p. 36) The area has also shown a similarity in the construction of fortifications, which became characteristic during the later Bronze Age. This construction is characterized by the placement of multi walls, use of confining tumuli, and leaving a wall encircled open space at the entrance. These construction elements could be seen In Borsh, QeparoLleshan, Tren and as far as Glasinac (Verecevo, Stipanic, Zagrovoc) and Liburnia (Budin, Oton, Dusar). (Ceka, N., Iliret, p. 36) Late Bronze, Illyrian ans w. Macedonian pottery 
<p>These common cultural similarities would be reflective of formation of an ethnicity with specific cultural attributes that had taken shape during the Middle Bronze period. This was the result of a reality in which life from the Neolithic period had continued uninterrupted in the development of a distinct culture. The introduction of pastoral economy brought along by the new comers, as well as economic advances, associated with changes in means of production, must have been prime contributors in the integration of the population. The new economy would have necessitated a breakdown of the existing tribal structures. At about the end of the second millennium B.C., southern Balkans experienced sizable population movements which some have called Doric invasion, some others Illyrian invasion, and others have used other names. The invaders were a group of people that are identified to have brought urnfield culture south. Krahe (1955) had indicated that the Illyrians were the bearers of this culture which had developed by the fusion of the Danubian Yamnaya cultures. Elements of this civilization, reached Albania towards the end of the Bronze Age. (The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, p. 228) The well known Albanian archeologist Frano Prendi summarized the evidence and the scope of impact of migratory waves at the end of Bronze Age that Albanian territories had faced. 
<p>In this transitional period which was to last some three centuries with each century providing new elements in its material culture, several components are discernible: the autochthonous tradition, elements of sub-Mycenaean and Proto-Geometric civilization, and elements of Cental European origin which were spread through Albania by the second wave of the Pannono-Balkan migration (end of the twelfth and the eleventh centuries B.C.). This wave, unlike the first, had a marked influence on Albania, although only in some areas. 
<p>Of the number of cultural objects which spread from the north in all directions, there are swords with a tongue-shaped hilt (see Plates Vol.), flame-shaped spear-heads and socketed axes, which become fairly common in this period, and also pins with conical or vase-shaped heads (Vasenkopfnadeln), simple arched fibulae with or without buttons, whose origin, in all likelihood, is from the Liburno-Dalmatian coast, and so on. The earliest examples of this type with its many variants are recorded so far in the regions bordering southern Albania, as for example, at Dukat in Vlore, and are completely absent in the interior, as far as we know. This phenomenon suggests a purely maritime circulation of these eleventh and tenth century fibulae via the Adriatic.

This phenomenon suggests a purely maritime circulation of these eleventh and tenth century fibulae via the Adriatic. 
<p>In spite of the special influence of the Urnfield civilization which played an important role in the enrichment of the Early Iron Age civilization in Albania, especially in the south, one must emphasize that it did not impose any essential difference on the autochthonous foundation of Albanian civilization, and even less on the ethnic structure of the population. This can be seen most clearly in the uninterrupted practice of burial rites in tumuli, the customary inhumation in the Illyrian manner being in the contracted position. The small number of urn-burials, for instance in the Bare tumuli, can be associated with the influence of the second wave of the Pannono- Balkan migration in Albania, but the objects found in them are with a few exceptions typically Illyrian objects. The pottery particularly is derived without stylistic modifications from the Late Bronze Age. Thus, for example, in the Korce basin and the adjoining areas, the pottery of the first era of the Iron Age is almost identical in technique, shape and decoration with the Late Bronze Age painted pottery of Maliq, so that it is often difficult to distinguish between them. This is an important factor in demonstrating the continuity of the tradition of the' Devollian' pottery from the Late Bronze Age period into the Early Iron Age and even down to the sixth century B.C. These facts establish convincingly the Illyrian character of this beautiful 'Devollian' pottery with its painted geometric designs.60 Our view is reinforced by the facts that this pottery appeared here earlier than in Macedonia and that it derived from the earlier pottery of Maliq (see above, p. 222). This is why we insist that the archaeological evidence is overwhelming, and should not be considered insufficient, as some authorities would claim,61 to prove the attribution of this Devollian painted pottery of the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age to the Southern Illyrian group. 
<p>The tumulus-burials of the Bronze and Early Iron Ages in Albania are of various types: simple pits, as at Barf, Mati and Pazhok; cist-graves made of lateral slabs of soft stone partly buried in the earth and covered with one or more slabs laid one on top of another, as at Vajze, Dropull, Bajkaj etc.; wooden coffins as at Pazhok, and pits lined and covered with stones, as at Barf, Mat, Dukat, Pazhok, Kukes, etc. In spite of their diversity these tombs, as their contents indicate, appear to be associated both chronologically and ethnically. It is significant too that these different types of tomb continued in general use over a long period, indeed until the end of the first part of the Early Iron Age. The conservatism indicated by the persistent use of these types of tomb is a new archaeological pointer to the ethnic continuity of their users, and helps to trace the genesis of ethnic identity amongst the Illyrian people in Albania. (The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, pp. 229-30) 
I<p>n conclusion, in the light of all that has been said, the question arises: who were the carriers of the Bronze Age civilization, and of that of the transitional period leading to the Iron Age, in Albania? Although the archaeological evidence is still limited, our study of it period by period has shown beyond doubt the continuous nature of the development of Illyrian civilization over the whole period under review, and enables us to view the peoples of the area as an established ethnic entity. This fact bears witness to the presence in the Albanian countryside of the same population throughout the whole of the Bronze Age and the transitional period to the Iron Age. This phenomenon is established more clearly than anywhere else at Maliq and in the Korce basin generally, where the materials of different phases of the Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age enable us to follow the uninterrupted evolution of the culture, with all the intermediate links from one stage to the next. In terms of history the archaeological evidence reveals a people which was growing up at this time peacefully and without interference from other ethnic groups, improving in its culture, its economic structure, and its internal social relationships; and this led. apparently towards the end of the Bronze Age, to the formation of the first ethnic communities with a common language and culture, namely the Illyrians. This process of the autochthonous formation of the Illyrian race began, according to the evidence of Maliq, at the beginning of the Bronze Age, on the basis of new economic cultural and ethnic structures in which the earliest migrations of the nomadic Indo-European shepherds certainly played an important part. These migrations interrupted the Eneolithic development of the area. This is seen in Maliq Ilia, whose culture, as far as we have uncovered it, has traits organically different from the Eneolithic culture of Maliq (Maliq II a and b). In penetrating into the Korce basin, this Indo-European group did not drive out or destroy the local population. On the contrary, it intermingled with them, imposing some elements of its language and culture and also its type of economy, while retaining for a period a number of the traits and methods of production of the native Eneolithic culture, at least up to the end of Maliq Illb, at which time the Early Bronze Age culture at Maliq succeeded in establishing itself as an individual culture with strictly local traits. It is exactly from this autochthonous base that we see the uninterrupted internal process of the formation of Illyrian culture in the southeastern area of Albania. To sum up, we may recall that at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (Maliq Ilia), when new Indo-European elements of a different race became fused with the native Eneolithic elements, a new ethnocultural base was created. On this base there developed in turn the beginning of the slow and very complex process of the formation of the Illyrian race which was to reveal clearly defined traits in the Late Bronze Age. Thus the Illyrians created and developed their culture in the course of the Bronze Age in Albania, in close liaison of course with neighbouring countries, and in particular with the Aegean world.(p. 237) 
<p>Thus, according to the Albanian archeologists it would be wrong to identify the XIII-IX invasions as Illyrian, and magnify the effect of this invasion on Albanian territories.Â Their findings were in direct contradiction to the view that had taken hold with some historians and focused on the assumption that XIII-IX B.C. invasions from the north had overwhelmed western Balkans. Some historians see have seen these incasions as marking the introduction of the Illyrians to the southern Balkans. In particular, N.G.L. Hammond who has been a support of that view of an early Greek culture and language emergence in Greece as well as adjoining areas to the north, in territories such as Epirus and Macedonia, responded quickly to the Albanian interpretation of data to alleviate any threat to his views. Focusing exclusively on discovered tumuli and especially those dated after the onset of the Iron Age, he did not comment much on the significance of the older tumuli, and would conclude: Two sites, Vajze and Vodhine, had tumuli which were first constructed and used in the Middle Bronze Age, if not earlier, and were then re-used towards the end of the Late Bronze Age and on into the Early Iron Age, presumably by people who claimed some connexion with the original 'heroes'. In the period of re-use the bronze weapons and ornaments from these and other tumuli swords, spear-heads and long pins were unusual in being engraved and in having distinctive features such as facetting on the socket of a javelin-head, and this has led to the conclusion that an independent metal-working establishment existed in the northern area (see above, pp. 224^, and that it produced short swords with some Mycenaean features but with other aspects which were 'uncanonical' in terms of Aegean archaeology. 
<p>The following tumuli have been excavated in north Epirus: four tumuli (all that there were) at Vajze, which lies beside a route from the Gulf of Valona to the Aous valley; one of six tumuli near Dukat, south-east of the Gulf of Valona, on the route southwards; one tumulus at £epune near Kardhiq on the west side of the Drin valley, through which the main route runs; four tumuli out of large cemeteries of tumuli at Vodhine, Kakavi and Bodrishte, situated quite close together in the Kseria valley, through which the main route in antiquity ran on to Dodona; one tumulus at Bajkaj near Delvino by the route from the plain of Butrinto to the Drin valley.24 Although many more tumuli await excavation, it has become clear that the rulers of these districts in Epirus had a common culture and that their contacts and affinities were rather with the rulers of the Korce plain at Barf than with those of the Mati valley. Yet they were distinct from the peoples of South Epirus, where tumuli have been found only recently (below, p. 636). 
<p>At Vajze Tumulus A and Tumulus B were re-used in the Late Bronze Age and in the Early Iron Age, and Tumulus C and Tumulus D were constructed first probably in the Early Iron Age. A and B had several graves which contained long bronze pins only, usually a pair to a grave but sometimes a single specimen; D had four graves, each with a single pin. The long pins were often engraved with zig-zags, and some modification of dress was presumably responsible for the change from a pair of pins to the evidently later practice of using a single pin on the dress of the corpse. Similar long bronze pins have been reported from graves at Leskoviq and were found in the tumulus at Barf; they occur less frequently in Macedonia and only in some of the earliest burials at Vergina, which belong, on the dating proposed here, to the eleventh century B.C.. As these long pins with their small top and slight swelling a little way down from the top were apparently designed to hold a wrap-over garment of heavy cloth, such as the kapa worn today by nomadic shepherds, it is likely that they went out of use at Vergina when a settled community developed on a low-lying site, but continued in use in pastoral areas. In north Epirus their life seems to have run on until the invention of the spectacle fibulae and the iron pin. Now Tumulus A Grave9 at Vajze had a pair of long bronze pins and a single iron pin with a funnel-shaped top, presumably from two persons buried within the same period; and the outer tumulus at Vodhine had a grave with a long bronze pin, engraved with zig-zags, and a bronze spectacle fibula of the Ig class which was early in the series. At Vergina the earliest iron pins were about 800 B.C. and the earliest spectacle fibula of this class about 950-900 B.C. 
<p>At Vajze three warrior-graves remain to be considered. Tumulus C Grave 2 contained long iron pins, an unusually long olive-leaf-shaped spear-head of iron (37-5 cm) and two bronze beads, objects which, on the basis of chronology in Macedonia, date the burial to within the period 800-600 B.C. Tumulus A Grave 2 contained a twisted pin of iron, a knife of iron, pierced biconical bronze beads and a pierced reel of bronze, biconical in shape with collared ends; and this burial should be dated likewise within the same span. Tumulus A Grave 8 contained an iron sword of the slashing variety, 85 cm long, a bronze spear-head of the flame-shaped class, 37 mushroom-shaped bronze buttons, which were pierced to hold a hemispherical rivet, and two rectangular plaques of shaped bone. As the plaques were most probably belt ornaments of a protective kind, it is likely that the buttons strengthened a leather jerkin. The buttons had an early form of fitting. The inventory of this burial may be compared with that of a burial in the only tumulus so far excavated at Kakavi. There a slab-lined cist-grave at ground level was roofed with a large slab, and the tumulus, 16 m in diameter, was constructed over a circular wall three stones high, within which the ground was paved with limestone flags. The warrior had a bronze sword with a fish-tailed top (like that found at Barf), a small iron knife with one bronze rivet (fig. 59-5 )>25 a PZiT of iron tweezers 5 cm long, two sheets of bronze plaque rectangular in shape with a hole at each corner for a rivet, and a piece of bone plaque incised with two sets of concentric circles, at the centres of which there was a hole for a nail. It seems that this warrior wore the same sort of reinforced belt and reinforced jerkin as the warrior of Vajze A8. Both graves, Vajze A8 and Kakavi I, belong to the first stage in the use of iron when it was employed alongside bronze. If we follow the sequence in Macdeonia, the iron tweezers indicate a date not later than 900-800 B.C. ; but the argumentum ex absentia in another region is far from conclusive in archaeology, and the two graves may be somewhat earlier. 
<p>Near Dukat a double tumulus consisted of an inner tumulus of stones, one metre high and ten metres in diameter, and an outer, larger tumulus of soil with a peribolos of stones. The earliest burials were under the stones, and the next were let into the upper part of the stones; the first burials in the outer tumulus were cist-tombs. The construction of the original tumulus was dated by the excavator to the Late Bronze Age, and its contents included a bronze diadem, as at Barf, leaf-shapedÂ javelin-heads and a leaf-shaped spear-head of bronze, as at Vajze and Bajkaj, which belong around noo B.C. The outer tumulus was made in the eleventh century, and its earlier burials had a Protogeometric vase, as at Bajkaj, a short uncanonical bronze sword, as at Bare, a pair of bronze tweezers, as at Kakavi, and a bronze knife of a Glasinac type; and the later burials were remarkable for bronze and iron fibulae of Italian and Submycenaean types, a bronze pin with a conical head and a bronze pendant - these all within the period 900-700 B.C. A leaf-shaped bronze spear-head with a very short, facetted socket was found at a near-by cave, Duke Gjoni. 
<p>In the double tumulus at Vodhine the latest artefact in the lower tumulus, which was sealed off by a dome of shingle, was a javelin-head with a facetted socket, probably displaced from its original position. Similar javelin-heads have been found at Pazhok, Peshkopi (Black Drin valley), Maliq, Duke Gjoni (Dukat), and Cepune, and their dates may be between 1200 and 1000 B.C.27 In the upper tumulus only one of the nine slab-lined cist-graves had offerings, namely a long bronze pin, having a conical head and being engraved with zig-zags, and a small bronze spectacle fibula, which may be dated c. 950-900 B.C. It seems likely that this double tumulus was used continuously from the last phase of the Late Bronze Age down to this last date.  At Bodrishte, also in the Kseria valley, two tumuli had been rifled and all that remained were a lunate ring of bronze in one tumulus, and five pieces of bronze plaque edging-strip (for a shield) and nine bronze buttons in the other tumulus, which had two slab-lined cist-graves. Perhaps the warriors here, like those of Vajze A8 and Kakavi I, were active around 900-800 B.C. 
A tumulus 22 m in diameter has been excavated by Dhimosten Budina at Cepune and was found to contain sixty-three burials. The earliest of these were reported to be a cremation, in which the corpse had been burnt outside its slab-lined cist-grave, and three inhumations in slab-lined cist-graves. Offerings in these cases included spear-heads, javelin-heads, and long pins of bronze; of the javelin-heads one was fiddle-shaped with a facetted socket, as at Vodhine. Some of the pottery had knobs and nipples as at Barf. The latest burials were of the third century B.C. Another tumulus, 20 m in diameter, has been excavated by the same 27 scholar at Bajkaj near Delvino. It contained some forty-four burials, of which the latest were attributed to the tenth century B.C. The pottery included a pot influenced by Protogeometric style. The start of the tumuli at Cepune and at Bajkaj was dated by the excavator to within the twelfth century. 
<p>Brief though the reports of these excavations are, they make up a clear picture. New rulers established themselves in north Epirus in the course of the twelfth century and their descendants used the same burial places for some centuries; at Bajkaj and Vodhine till late in the tenth century, at Bodrishte and Kakavi till late in the ninth century, at Dukat till 700 B.C., at Vajze till 700/650 B.C., and at Cepune till within the third century B.C. It is possible that the abandonment of some tumuli in north Epirus is to be connected with the spread of speakers of North-west Greek into central Greece and the northern Peloponnese. For tumuli with some cremations and some inhumations in stone-lined trenches appeared in the tenth century at Vranesi in Boeotia; and a circular peribo/os of stones within which there were slab-lined cist-graves with some hand-made pottery, the whole no doubt originally covered with a tumulus, has been found at Agriapidhies, south of Patras in Achaea, and dated tentatively to the tenth century. Other tumuli were made first in the eighth century at Anavyssos in Attica and at Chalandhritsa in Achaea. 
<p>The first tumulus to be found in Greek Epirus was interestingly at the only settlement-site of Mycenaean times, Ephyra, close to the Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron. Built originally against the inside face of a fortification wall, the tumulus has a rough peribo/os of field stones, oval in shape and approximately twelve metres in diameter, and most of the fill has disappeared since the collapse of the fortification wall. Enough remains to show that the tumulus had contained several burials with hand-made local pottery and offerings of bronze and iron. One burial, which was superimposed on another, had a bronze pin with a hemispherical head, a steatite whorl and an imported skyphos, which were attributed to the end of LH IIIC but might be later. A second tumulus alongside the first is under excavation. The crudeness of the peribo/os and the poverty of what remains suggest that the tumuli were made after the collapse of Mycenaean Ephyra by people from farther north, probably pastoralists coming there every year for the winter and taking their flocks for the summer to high pastures such as belonged to the site we consider next. (The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, p. 632) 
<p>Professor Hammond basically ends up relisting Albanian findings without disputing much, and making some vague comments to the effect that signify new intrusions from the north. He indicates new rulers established themselves in north Epirus in the course of the twelfth century and their descendants used the same burial places for some centuries. The emphasis is on the new rulers on which Professor Hammond commences his analysis.He indicates that Vajze and Vodhine (both in the extreme south of Albania), had tumuli which were first constructed and used in the Middle Bronze Age, if not earlier, and were then re-used towards the end of the Late Bronze Age and on into the Early Iron Age but chooses not to specify any significance to the fact of this apparent tradition of tumulus use in the area. The question arises then as to how well founded is the talk about â€œnew rulers intruding into the area, and especially if it is meant new rulers of a different culture and rites. He does not touch on the Albanian archeologists contention that the only invasion they could trace from the north at the end of Bronze Age is that of people that brought Urnfield burial practice south. 
<p>Hammond seems to have difficulty to directly dispute Albanian archeologists data, but attempts to find other ways of sticking to his view of late Illyrian intrusions. In face of the tumuli found north of the today's Albanian border, he states â€œit has become clear that the rulers of these districts in Epirus had a common culture and that their contacts and affinities were rather with the rulers of the Korce plain at Barf than with those of the Mati valley. Yet they were distinct from the peoples of South Epirus, where tumuli have been found only recently. (p.633) Thus, he accepts the cultural similarity of the area, but excludes south Epirus by the reason that only recently tumuli have been found there. This is an unconvincing rational why Epirus would be different from the area north of it at the end of Bronze Age or say at the beginning of Iron Age. The discovery of many burials in Albania during 1960's and 1970 was the result of a policy to study the subsurface. I don't think there had been such a policy for south Epirus at any time. 
<p>Albanian archeologists had established that Maliqi culture had continued to be a major Balkan center and â€œthe effect of Maliqi culture could be observed in settlements at Drin and Mat River valleys. Similarities in decoration and cult objects are also noted with settlements in Dardania (Hisar I, Glladnice Bubanj Hun Ia),Pelagonia (Servia, Armenohori). More general affinities are observed Dikili-Tash (Thessaly), Sulkuca (Rumania), Krividol (Bulgaria) and as far as Troy. Maliqi cultural effects extended to the north also, not solely to southern Epirus. NLG Hammond seems to be contradicting himself here. He is accepting the cultural effects from a long established center, thus deviating from his held view that changes had come from invasions to the north. Or maybe there were no new rulers and if there were they had succumbed to the existing culture, which is in line with Albanian archeologists contention that Albanian territories only marginally were affected by the new invasions. 
<p>It would be only logical that Epirus maintain contacts and affinities with the Korce plain at Barf rather than with those of the Mati valley. It is geographically a closer area, and most likely a more influential center. Bu at the same time Albanian archeologists have observed common cultural affinities between Maliq IIIc and that of Nezir (Mat), the latter also relating to the interior of southern Adriatic, which later was to be known as Mat-Glasinac(Bosnia) culture. Thus, cultural affinities that characterize Maliq and Epirus, extend to Mat and further northwest to Glasnic. What should be emphasized here is that this form of burial, once it had appeared in Albania, continued without interruption throughout the Late Bronze and Early Iron periods, becoming at this time a specific part of the Illyrian ethnic tradition. In spite of their diversity, these tombs, as their contents indicate, appear to be associated both chronologically and ethnically. It is significant too that these different types of tomb continued in general use over a long period, indeed until the end of the first part of the Early Iron Age. The conservatism indicated by the persistent use of these types of tomb is a new archaeological pointer to the ethnic continuity of their users, and helps to trace the genesis of ethnic identity amongst the Illyrian people in Albania. Tumuli dating to Middle Helladic period have been found throughout the western Greece, and one was discovered even in Attica (Machowski, Wojciech, Studies in Ancient Art and Civilization, Krakow, 2007). Malthi tumulus contained Adriatic ware (The Cambridge Ancient History, II, Part 1, 2000, p. 127) which would be an indication that the settlers practiced the same burial ritual as the people to the north and a commonality in other cultural elements. 
<p>About the tumulus found in south Epirus, Ephyra he indicates: remains suggest that the tumuli were made after the collapse of Mycenaean Ephyra by people from farther north, probably pastoralists coming there every year for the winter and taking their flocks for the summer. This is an attempt to take this tumulus out its proper place in the long tradition of burial practice of the population. He explains, that Ephyra is probably the work of pastoralists, which in other words, is different from Iron Age tumuli which were made for important rulers! The underlying assumptions for this statement area the tumulus has nothing to do with area's tradition of tumulus use and it probably came intruding pasoralists into the area, nothing permanent. In accordance to all available data, it would be more logical to conclude that Ephyra tumuli are reflective of area's long established tradition of tumulus burial ritual. 
<p>And about Vitsa in Zagoria he would indicate, that the offerings with men, women and children show connections with the last pre-Illyrian phase at Vergina, with the Illyrian phase at Kuci Zi, with the burials of north Epirus and with southern Greece (The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008, p. 638) Although Professor Hammond likes to use the term â€œpre-Illyrian, which comes from his assumption that Illyrians are late comers into the area, at the same time he does see an Illyrian between the mentioned centers. 
<p>There is a good sampling of discoveries to Middle Bronze, and late Bronze Age era tumuli throughout Albania. One should also mention Ephyra and Vista in south Epirus. This ritual becomes very common during the Iron Age. Leaving aside these unsubstantiated views, and based on the chronology of tumuli mentioned above, it would appear that the burial tradition that came with the early settlers continued uninterrupted to the Iron Age. And, as a result, there is no basis to conceive an interruption in this tradition. What came to be known as Illyrian ritual of tumulus-burial followed a long tradition in the area and cannot be characterized only as an Iron Age phenomenon. According to Albanian archaeologists, as noted above, evidence indicates that subsequent migrations to the area have not been extensive in scope to change the long cultural tradition of the area. 
<p>As concern the conflicting views about the involvement of Illyrian in the latest settlements, some maintain that Illyrians were a decisive factor while others claiming that they were not. Albanian archeologists are in line with the latter view. Their conclusion is summarized by Ceka and Korkuti indicating that the Illyrians of northwestern Balkans had no direct involvement in the settlements, as is also shown by the archeological evidence. At the same time, as indicated above,Â there were found in Albania cultural material that originated in the north during the first phase of the invasion. But at the same time, this material was so analogous to European models that it might indicate that it was a local production. (Ceka, N./Korkuti, M., Arkeologjia, 1998, p. 66) 
<p>It is interesting to note that the most recent wave of settlers from the invasion describe as Pannono-Balkan, practiced inhumation burial, but this ritual does not seem to have made a dent in the local burial practice; tumulus burial experienced no interruption, to the contrary it seems that during the Iron Age it continued to be widely practice. One important fact that speaks for the non-involvement of Illirians in this invasion is the indication that material objects found in Greece and connected with the invasion are not accompanied by Illyrian pottery. Ceka, N./Korkuti, M., p. 66) 
It appears that these conclusions are exactly what N. L. G. Hammond was not ready to accept. In his view, the multitude of tumuli found in Albanian indicates the thrust of Illyrians in the area at the beginning of the Iron Age. On the bases of this assumption he would write, It is possible that the abandonment of some tumuli in north Epirus is to be connected with the spread of speakers of North-west Greek into central Greece and the northern Peloponnese. 
<p>Albanian archeologists do recognize some impact from the second phase (end of the twelfth and the eleventh centuries B.C.) of this invasion, as indicated above. They maintain that from this invasion the migrants probably set in motion groups of the Illyrian population both within the country and beyond it. In support of these Illyrian resettlements, it is pointed out that the Iapyges, the Messapians and the Chonians probably left the eastern coasts of the Adriatic for Italy during this period. The name of the last suggests some kinship with the Chaonians of the southern shores of Albania. Of the number of cultural objects which spread from the north in all directions, there are swords with a tongue-shaped hilt (see Plates Vol.), flame-shaped spear-heads and socketed axes, which become fairly common in this period, and also pins with conical or vase-shaped heads (Vasenkopfnadeln), simple arched fibulae with or without buttons, whose origin, in all likelihood, is from the Liburno-Dalmatian coast, and so on. The earliest examples of this type with its many variants are recorded so far in the regions bordering southern Albania, as for example, at Dukat in Vlore, and are completely absent in the interior, as far as we know. This phenomenon suggests a purely maritime circulation of these eleventh and tenth century fibulae via the Adriatic. According to this view the impact of this Immigration was limited, and, if it had caused population movements in Epirus, it was the Illyrian tribes that were affected. The inference that the language of the area was North-west Greek is pervious and has no historic support. R. A. Crossaland elaborated about the language of this area prior to the onset of Iron Age and concluded that The phonetic characteristics of some place-names in central and northern Greece have been thought to prove that Illyrians or closely related peoples were settled there before the Greek language was introduced . If they were, Greeks must have migrated into southern Epirus early in the first millennium at the latest. (pp. 841-2, R. A. Crossland, The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume III, Part 1, 2008) 
<p>Although archeological Bronze Age data for south Epirus area, in addition to the two tumuli mentioned above, is limited, evidence that is available is similar to that found north of this area. One thing that has been pointed out is the find of potsherds at Dodona, which probably represent a settlement of M. H. time and shows distant connection with Macedonia. (p. 127, The Cambridge Ancient History, II, part 1, 2000). N. G. L. Hammond himself indicated that "The archeological evidence shows that Greek culture, as revealed in pottery and other objects, did not penetrate into inland Epirus, except at Dodona and there only to a very limited extent, until the fourth century". (N.G.L. Hammond, Epirus: the geography, the ancient remains, the history and topography of Epirus and adjacent areas, Clarendon P., 1967) 
<p>Other than the archeological data that has been summarized here, not much else is known about the population that inhabited the area. Early classical authors refer to the pre-historic population by the name Pelasgian. Strabo specifically mentioned Thessaly and Epirus as having been Pelasgian populated. Roman historian Justin indicated that Macedonia was also populated by Pelasgians. Many historians have included all pre-Greek and pre-Illyrian population under this name. 
<p>We don't know the effect of migrations. It is logical to assume that the language of the settlers had already formed at their place of origin. The fact that the languages that were eventually to rise, Greek and Illyrian came to vary from each other, one has to assume that of the effect of the new comers on language of the original population was not similar, at least in scope, on all the areas. There is written evidence confirms this. Homer has Odysseus say â€œthere is a land called Creteâ€¦and therein are many man innumerable, and ninety cities. And all have not the same speech, but there is confusion of tongues; there dwell Achaeans and there too Cretans of Crete, high of heart, and Cydonians there Dorians of waving plums and goodly Pelasgians. ( S. H. Butcher/A. Lang, Macmillan and Co., 1912, Odyssey XIX, 173-178, p. 316). It would appear that there were extensive population moves and Pelasgian element in Crete was a minority at that time, as were they in mainland Greece(as ancient authors indicated). But then, when Homer mentions Epirus, to the north, he infers that the area was Pelasgian, he says lord Zeus, Dodonaian, Pelasgian, whose habitation is far away! O thou ruler of tempestuous Dodana! and about thee the Selloi dwell (Rouse, W. H. D., The Illiad, The New American Library, 1938, p. 192) 
<p>By classical times only traces of Pelasgians remained in mainland Greece. Herodotus indicated, judging by those that still remain of the Pelasgians who dwelt in the city of Creston above the Tyrsenians, and who were once neighbours of the race now called Dorian, dwelling then in the land which is now called Thessaliotis, and also by those that remain of the Pelasgians who settled at Plakia and Skylake in the region of the Hellespont, who before that had been settlers with the Athenians, and of the natives of the various other towns which are really Pelasgian, though they have lost the nameâ€¦. If therefore all the Pelasgian race was such as these, then the Attic race, being Pelasgian, at the same time when it changed and became Hellenic, unlearnt also its language. For the people of Creston do not speak the same language with any of those who dwell about them, nor yet do the people of Plakia, but they speak the same language one as the other (Herodotus, The Histories, Clio, LVII) There is no evidence that the autochthonous population northwest of Greece had experienced similar changes in its development. As to the scope of impact of the last migration not much could be said for certain. Based on archeological evidence submitted above that sees the impact as limited, it would be reasonable to conclude that by the dawn of Iron Age, the autochthonous population and its language survived much unscathed.
