Because of their historical connection with the Patriarchate, the Greeks came to represent, and speak on the behalf, of the entire Christendom in Europe and Asia. The Orthodox Patriarchate, shielded by Ottoman might, enjoyed power and prestige to a degree unknown even during the heyday of Byzantium…As an ethnic group, the Greeks were the first to be given positions within the high Ottoman bureaucracy without having to convert to Islam… p. 46

Aided by this privileged position and strong european economic considerations as a trading distribution center, as well as western infatuation with ancient Greece,  Greeks were able to create a fast expanding middle class which, in turn, caused an increase in the size of the Greek-speaking population and of groups that identified with the Greek Patriarchate, regardless of their ethnic origins. 47 <img src="http://albter.eu5.org/images/7-page-0011.jpg" width="247" height="162" align="right" />

It was a reality where people were identified on the bases of religion and not ethnicity. All Moslems were classified as Turks, while the privileged Greek position in the Ottoman Empire distorted the identification of people in favor of “Greeks”.  The term “Greeks” (Rum) originally encompassed all Orthodox Christians; however, during the the nineteenth century it acquired a narrower meaning, and those who who retains their allegations to the Istanbul patriarchate and to to the other Greek national churches… came to be termed “Orthodox Greeks.” p. 108 The primary victim of this policy were the Albanians, majority of Albanians were identified as Muslim, and the Orthodox Christians, could not have their own national church and were classified as Greeks.

Thus when it comes to determining the size of the Albanian population, the known numbers are only a guesstimate. But even these estimates, prove that a drastic reduction of Albanian population occurred during the eighteenth century, more specifically after the Greek independence. In 1840 a population 1,500,000 Albanians was estimated. By 1876-78 the estimate had been reduced to 1,031,000, but evidently many of Albanians were put under the classification “Greek Albanians” (in addition to the classification “Orthodox Albanians”; this figure also excluded Albanians within the state of independent Greece). By 1890’s the Albanian population is estimated at 1,217,000, indicating that substantial number of Albanians ceased to be counted as Albanian.

The the well known practice of misidentifying populations by Balkan governments and nationalist associations was common. All tried to enlarge their respective nationalities and accordingly reduce other groups. The claimed numbers were so unreliable, so that  H. Synge, a military officer sent especially by the British embassy in Istanbul to find out exact number of the Macedonian population, stated in a preliminary report that the total Greek male population of Selanik, Manastir, Serez. and Drama amounted in 1878 to only 166,064, as against 116,024 Bulgarians, 50,152 Vlahs (Romanians, and 25,043 Albanians (who also recognized the Greek Patriarchate in Istanbul)…p.48

The unfortunate truth is that these false claims effective in convincing European powers to decide to the determent of  the Albanians when it came to determining borders of Albania, and in the process designating large Albanian populations as non-entities. But the reality is that this is symptomatic of how Balkan nations have evolved, on false claims and at the expense of the Albanians.
